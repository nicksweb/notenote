= NoteNote

This Notebook application was built with Rails following Mackenzie Child's tutorial (https://mackenziechild.me/12-in-12/11/)

== Overview

This application includes:

* Users

* Notes (title, content)

* Conditional routes depending if user_signed_in?

* Custom styling from the tutorial

I plan on adding some features to the Notes model, such as image uploading using the 'Paperclip' gem.
